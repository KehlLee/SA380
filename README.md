All of our work is contained solely in the file _Machine Learning Project.ipynb_ in this repository ordered according to the homework instructions. You can check the code, view the result, and redo some parts in the notebook. As we worked collectively, you can also find our workspace on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BFzKaIWkVamgyr0q7TVdNjFUcTSVz_ne?usp=sharing). 

Many thanks to both professors and the TAs for this session!
